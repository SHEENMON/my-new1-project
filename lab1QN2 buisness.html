The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday cautioned banks against having ‚Äúlakhs of accounts‚Äù used for fraudulent transactions and evergreening of loan accounts. <br>
‚ÄúWe found certain banks having lakhs of such accounts with apparently no valid reason. Some of these accounts were also used as a conduit for certain fraudulent transactions and ever-greening of loan accounts. Internal accounts are high risk in nature on account of its potential for misuse,‚Äù RBI Deputy Governor Swaminathan J said at a Conference of statutory auditors and chief financial officers of commercial banks and financial institutions. <br>
‚ÄúI would also urge CFOs to invest in technology and data analytics which would empower them to provide more accurate and real-time financial insights. This not only aids in strategic decision-making but also enhances the ability to respond swiftly to any issues identified during audits or supervisory reviews,‚Äù he said. <br>
<h2>Financial Inclusion-Index rises to 64.2 in March 2024</h2>
The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), which captures the extent of financial inclusion across the country, stood at 64.2 in March 2024 from 60.1 in March 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Wednesday. <br>
The improvement in the index was due to growth witnessed across all sub-indices, the RBI said. <br>
The index captures information on various aspects of financial inclusion in a single value ranging between 0 and 100, where 0 represents complete financial exclusion and 100 indicates full financial inclusion. <br>
<h2>Rupee falls 1 paisa to 83.50 against US dollar</h2>
In the domestic equity market, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended the day 36.22 points, or 0.05 per cent, lower at 79,960.38 points. The broader NSE Nifty settled 3.30 points, or 0.01 per cent, up at 24,320.55 points. <br>
The rupee pared initial gains to settle 1 paisa lower at 83.50 against the US dollar on Monday, as muted domestic equities weighed on investor sentiments. <br>
At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.45 and hit the intraday high of 83.44 and a low of 83.50 against the American currency during the session. <br>
It finally settled at 83.50 against the dollar, registering a loss of one paisa over the previous close. <br> </p>
