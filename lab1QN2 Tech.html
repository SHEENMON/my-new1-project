The seat meant it could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.

Microsoft has ditched the board observer seat at OpenAI that has drawn regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, saying it was not necessary after the AI start-upâ€™s governance had improved significantly in the past eight months. <br>
<span style="color:blue;"><u>Apple,</u></span> which last month announced bringing OpenAIâ€™s chatbot ChatGPT to its devices, would not take the observer role on OpenAIâ€™s board after being widely expected to do so, the Financial Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. <br>
An OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as <span style="color:blue;"><u>Microsoft</u></span> and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures. <br>

Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2024 Live: Samsung is back with its highly anticipated Galaxy Unpacked event for 2024. At the event, the Android smartphone maker is expected to introduce its premium foldable devices, smartwatches, accessories, and more. The latest hardware and software announcements from the South Korean company come at a time when the smartphone market is witnessing an influx of AI-powered solutions. <br>
While the in-person event is taking place in Paris, it will be livestreamed on the companyâ€™s official profiles on <span style="color:blue;"><u>Facebook</u></span> and YouTube. The major highlights of the event are said to be the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, and the Galaxy Watch Ultra. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 are touted to be more powerful than their predecessors. <br>
The event will also showcase how <span style="color:blue;"><u>Samsung</u></span> will infuse Galaxy AI into its latest line of products. The iconography of Galaxy AI on the promotional materials for the Unpacked event has already stirred the interest of Samsung fans. Users can expect a significant update on Samsungâ€™s AI software. While Samsung is expected to launch four key products, speculations are rife that it will also unveil the health-focused Galaxy Ring, which was previewed at Samsungâ€™s January event. There is also a faint possibility that the tech giant may showcase its AR headset which has been reportedly under development with <span style="color:blue;"><u>Google</u></span>. <br>
<h2>Apple iOS 18: How to set up and use the new â€˜Eye Trackingâ€™ feature on iPhone</h2>
The latest iOS 18 beta introduces a new feature called 'Eye Tracking', which, as the name suggests, lets you control your iPhone using eye movements. Here's how to enable it. <br>
Earlier this year, <span style="color:blue;"><u>Apple</u></span> announced that the iPhone and iPad would soon be getting several new accessibility features, one of them being the ability to control iOS-powered devices using eyes. While the upcoming functionality will be available with the public release of iOS 18, it is currently available for those on the latest iOS 18 Developer Beta. <br>
<span style="color:blue;"><u>Apple</u></span> says its Eye Tracking feature doesnâ€™t require any new hardware and works by using the Face ID camera. If you are on the latest iOS 18 beta, hereâ€™s how to set up the new feature that lets you control your phone or tablet just using your eyes. <br>
Before you set up the new Eye Tracking feature, place your iPhone on a flat surface with a distance of almost half a metre from your face. Also, make sure that the Face ID camera lens is clean and that there is enough lighting in the room. Apple also recommends users not sit in a way that the camera is not directly facing a light source as it might make it difficult to track the userâ€™s eye movements. <br> <\p>
