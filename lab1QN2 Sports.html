Argentina trumped Canada 2-0 in the Copa America 2024 semifinal at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday, reaching their second consecutive final. <br>
The defending champions were powered by goals from Julian Alvarez and skipper Lionel Messi, who secured his first of this edition. <br>
Argentina fended off early pressure as Alvarez darted past two defenders to open the scoring with a spotless finish in the 22nd minute. <br>
Messi doubled the lead in the 51st minute when he stuck out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandezâ€™s shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau. <br>

This is the third consecutive major final that Messiâ€™s side has made. The Albiceleste won the 2021 Copa America beating Brazil 1-0 in the final. They proceeded to win the 2022 Qatar World Cup, beating France 4-2 in the penalties after the final was tied 3-3 in extra time <br>
